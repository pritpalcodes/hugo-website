#### My name is Pritpal (प्रित्पाल/ਪ੍ਰਿਤਪਾਲ) Singh, however I am famous among my friends as **Preeto**. You can use the pronouns he/him/his when you talk about me in English. That picture up there really is a picture of me, but from 2012. A more recent photo of me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oye-pritpal/).

<!-- intel AI for youth got me started with coding, particularly ML, what I like about it the capability to have a real world impact
Then joined JIIT, still confused what to do, 
Interned at CoE in AI44Education, under Ashish Mishra, and had a learning curve


-->

#### During my ML internship, I dove headfirst into the world of machine learning, learning by doing and eagerly awaiting the certificate to prove it. This hands-on experience turbocharged my skills, making me the go-to engineer for tackling real-world ML challenges.


#### As an IEEE member, I rubbed shoulders with industry titans, captured memorable moments on stage, and polished my online persona on LinkedIn. These experiences broadened my horizons, keeping me ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.



#### Launching Side Kick Marketing was like turning a passion project into a powerhouse agency, bridging the gap between businesses and their digital dreams. This entrepreneurial adventure sharpened my strategic prowess, molding me into a versatile engineer with a knack for turning ideas into reality.



#### Currently, I'm knee-deep in the fascinating world of BCI and EEG signals, exploring the mind-bending possibilities at the intersection of neuroscience and tech. This mind-boggling tinkering fuels my hunger for innovation, ensuring I stay on the cutting edge of engineering prowess. 



#### I am fluent in English, Hindi, Punjabi, C++, Python, Java Script, SQL, C, Node.js, MongoDB and BrainF**k. And I have a decent level of proficiency in French, Poetry, React, Flask, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Langchain. I swim, bike, run, and lift weights in my free time.
