### I thrive on diving into projects headfirst, embracing challenges as opportunities to grow. I believe in learning by doing, even when starting with minimal expertise. 
<!-- ## Eager to contribute to collaborative endeavors.   -->

### `Development`

- #### [Cynthia Ugwu](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Cynthia-Ugwu-Portfolio-A-Modern-Webite).

    - Developed a modern responsive portfolio website for Cynthia Ugwu, a product designer in Toronto.
    - Demonstrates clean and functional design principles for showcasing design portfolios.
    - Utilized MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for development.
    - Deployed on AWS cloud platform for scalability and reliability.

- #### [Cavity Wizard](https://cavitywizard.com/)

    - Developed Cavity Wizard, an AI-driven initiative by SQH Technologies focusing on dental health education.
    - Implemented MERN stack technology for seamless functionality and user experience.
    - Integrated NLP and Machine Learning algorithms to predict caries risk, aligning with American Association of Pediatric Dentistry standards.


### `Machine Learning`
- #### [IPL Win Probability Prediction](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/ipl_win_predictor). 
    
    <!-- Have you ever checked the live score of any cricket match on google? I bet you have. And if you are a cricket fan, you would have noticed google offers a live _win probability_ prediction for any cricket match. My inner curative genius (and my 2rd yr Minor Project Deadline) motivated me to develop an end-to-end machine learning project using Python to predict the probability of an IPL cricket team winning a match given an instance of the match. -->
    - Utilized a comprehensive Machine Learning Development Life Cycle approach to ensure robustness and reliability of the model.
    - Used complex libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
    - Achieved a model accuracy of 79.16%, with precision of 79.57% and recall of 81.29%, resulting in an F1 Score of 80.42%.
    - Deployed the trained model effectively to provide real-time predictions, enhancing decision-making capabilities for cricket enthusiasts and team management.

- #### [CAPEC Web Attack Classifier](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/webAttack_Classifier_ML-Model).
    
    Successfully deployed the trained model into a production environment, enhancing cybersecurity measures with real-time threat detection capabilities.
    - Implemented 5 distinct multilabel machine learning algorithms for the identification and classification of web attacks.
    - Achieved a classification accuracy of 92% on the test dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of the ensemble approach.
    - Utilized Binary Relevance, Random Forest, Label Powerset, Multi-Output Classifier, and LightGBM algorithms to handle the intricate nature of web attack patterns.
    - Conducted extensive experimentation and evaluation, resulting in a 15% improvement in precision and recall compared to baseline models.


### `Computer Vision`
- #### [Gesture Based Gamification](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Hand_Detection_Module)
    
    - Implemented a hand detection algorithm to identify hand movements through the webcam.
    - Utilized finger position tracking to recognize specific gestures corresponding to game controls.
    - Interfaced with the game via simulated keyboard inputs, enabling seamless control based on detected gestures.
    - Provided a dynamic and immersive gaming experience, allowing players to interact with the game using intuitive hand gestures.


<!-- - [Snakes.py]().
    
    This classic "Snake & Apple" game, built using the 'pygame' module. It offers a great learning experience for Python beginners while incorporating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. -->


### `Operating Systems`
- #### [Multy Threaded Proxy Server](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/MultiThreadedProxyServer). 
    
    This project is implemented using C and Parsing of HTTP referred from the Proxy Server. 
    - Used Semaphore instead of Condition Variables and pthread_join() and pthread_exit() function.
    - pthread_join() requires us to pass the thread id of the the thread to wait for.
    - Semaphore’s sem_wait() and sem_post() doesn’t need any parameter. So it is a better option.
    
### `Data Structures`
- #### [Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualiser](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Dijkstra-s_Visualiser). 
    
    Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm visualization tool using Python with technologies such as Sigma JS for graph drawing.
    - Developed intuitive user interface for easy understanding and interaction with the algorithm's execution.
    - Achieved robust model training and deployment, ensuring efficient performance and seamless user experience.

<!-- 
- #### [Sorting Algorithms Visualiser](https://github.com/pritpalcodes/Sorting-Algorithms-Visualiser).

    Implemented Sorting Algorithms visualization tool using Python with technologies such as Sigma JS for graph drawing.
    - Developed intuitive user interface for easy understanding and interaction with the algorithm's execution.
    - Achieved robust model training and deployment, ensuring efficient performance and seamless user experience.
